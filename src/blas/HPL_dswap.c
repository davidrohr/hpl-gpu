 * Purpose

 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, N specifies the length of the vectors  x  and  y. N
 *         must be at least zero.
 *
 * X       (local input/output)          double *
 *         On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
 *         ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) )  that  contains the vector x.
 *         On exit, the entries of the incremented array  X  are updated
 *         with the entries of the incremented array Y.
 *
 * INCX    (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero.
 *
 * Y       (local input/output)          double *
 *         On entry,  Y  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
 *         ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCY ) )  that  contains the vector y.
 *         On exit, the entries of the incremented array  Y  are updated
 *         with the entries of the incremented array X.
 *
 * INCY    (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y.
 *         INCY must not be zero.
